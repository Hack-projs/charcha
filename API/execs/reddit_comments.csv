"     um... to be a nazi you needed to pledge allegiance to the furer (hitler) and the one true god (christian god). all nazi soldiers wore a belt buckle that said ""gott mit uns"" which literally translates to ""god is with us."" the german nazis also had chaplains that traveled with the groups and blessed them before battle, gave them communion, performed church services, and in the event the soldiers died, they performed last rites. the only bibles they burned were ones that were non catholic bibles.   "
"     in hitler's own book mein kampf, he thanks god multiple times for the power he has been given, and makes multiple references to god. people say hitler was an atheist, well atheists dont thank god because they do not believe in god.   "
"     now i can agree that what the nazis did is not very christian, but they most definitely did not do away with god, or church services.   "
 belt buckle issued to every nazi 
"     update: i have loads of responses to this, bear with me while i try and respond to them.   "
"     stories like this always remind me of a quote by g√∂ring: ""i will decide who is a jew."". how quickly these racist prejudices fall apart if you have an actual person of a specific faith/race in your circle that doesn't fit the stereotype at all, and how arbitrary, opportunistic and cynical the nazis were.   "
"     it would have taken so little for hitler to take a good look at bloch and instead of deciding that he was an exotic outlier ('a noble jew'), to come to the conclusion that there are millions of other jewish people equally worthy of respect and love, just like this man.   "
     iirc hitler brought this dude to the anschluss negotiations with austria specifically for his stern looks and intimidating demeanor   
     one of the first places hitler's nazis targeted during their book burnings was an institute primarily focused on figuring out how to help trans and gay people. it takes one google search to learn about this. (wikipedia article on said institute)

"     telford taylor's ""the anatomy of the nuremberg trials: a personal memoir"" describes this scene:   "
"     ""on the third day of the trial i witnessed, by chance, an episode which, apparently, no one else noticed and which gave me an impression of hess's condition. i was sitting in the courtroom at the american prosecution table while ralph albrecht was delivering his lecture on german governmental structure. it was my first opportunity to scrutinize the defendants and their counsel at leisure and close range. i was not paying close attention to albrecht's presentation, but i heard him say that hitler's ""successor-designate was first the defendant hess and subsequently the defendant goering."" this i well knew to be in error. the names were right but the order was wrong; goering was number two and hess number three.   "
"     since i was sitting barely twenty feet from those two gentlemen, i looked to see whether either of them had noticed the slip and, if so, how he reacted. goering was already waving his arms to attract attention, pointing to himself, and saying repeatedly: ""ich war der zweite!"" (""i was the second!"") as these protests were pouring out of goering, hess turned and looked at him and burst into laughter. it appeared to me that hess also knew that albrecht had misspoken (albrecht corrected the order of succession at the end of his presentation), and was vastly amused by goering's characteristically vain reaction. i inferred from this occurrence that hess's amnesia was not as complete as he had given out.""

     edit: huh. i awoke to far too many notifications. i should really tamp down on my exquisite wit and indelible humor that i just found out i have.   
     there are guys who have the balls to ask a dictator about hitler on a small boat in the middle of a river in freaking africa. and here i am too afraid to ask my father in law if he would help me paint my kitchen üòÇüòÇ   
"     he'd been minister president (? i forget the specific term) of prussia in the early days of the nazi regime, which made up about 2/3rds of germany. he also held an important parliamentary position, ran the air force, and was basically named heir to the chancellorship once the regime was secured. he was given a new special rank above field marshal just so he would be above the existing military officers that hitler didn't trust.   "
"     he'd spent a lot of time doing day to day running of things in a lot of important jobs (as much as nazis did that in their incredibly dysfunctional and self defeating system) and knew how everything worked, but in the later years of the war he was sidelined and basically demoted, hence why d√∂nitz took over in may 1945 instead. his assumption (from my understanding) was that he'd made himself indispensable to the allies because he was too embedded in the system, and he'd been demoted to the point where he assumed he wasn't important enough to execute. that was true of a lot of nazis, who after a few years were just let go and ended up back in the same jobs as before, because it turns out finding and excising all of the hardcore nazis in their own country is both very difficult and leaves you with no experienced people to run the country afterwards.
