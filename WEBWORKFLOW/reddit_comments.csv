     an examining magistrate has formally charged him with assault and battery and damaging property using violent means. on 3 january the examining magistrate placed yanike in custody. on monday magistrates decided that he should remain under lock and key for the time being at least.   
     this outfit was very specifically picked out.

     afaik trademark laws recognise that similar trademarks by different companies can exist in different geographical spheres or market sectors (the only exception being majorly known trademarks such as nike or apple).   
"     so the s√ºperlig, the superligaen or the greek superleague can coexist because they are based in different geographical areas. the european superleague is probably registered for the entirety of the eu, which would infringe on the trademark of these previous superleagues.   "

     nike spent over 5 billion in stock buybacks in 2023   
     reminds me of nike attempting to market the ‚Äòblack and tan‚Äô sneakers in ireland 10 or 15 years ago.   
     exactly   
     nike deserves more blame than they‚Äôre getting but fanatics doesn‚Äôt have some long history of quality product to point at and go ‚Äúsee? we normally do a good job!‚Äù   
"     answer: fanatics produces sports apparel via exclusive licensing deals with the nfl, nba, nhl, and the mlb. if you buy gear for your favorite team online, there is a very high chance that it is made by fanatics. for a long time now, they have had a reputation for extremely poor quality control. products will be cheaply made, with misaligned logos, improperly spaced letters, bad stitching, etc. but they have had no real incentive to improve qc because they have no real competitors.   "
"     since 2020, nike has been subcontracting the production of the uniforms players wear in-game to fanatics. fanatics produces the designs given to them by nike. this year, players are wearing the new nike vapor premier jerseys, which are designed to be ‚Äúlighter‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance wear‚Äù (according to the mlb commissioner). this, combined with poor qc from fanatics, have resulted in the uniforms being worn during spring training appearing like cheap knockoffs, which have been flooding social media recently as spring training kicks off. among the quality issues i mentioned above, it turns out the white pants on the new jerseys are actually transparent - you can see the ends of the jersey through the pants if a player has tucked them in.   "
"     the uproar is a combination of a lot of factors. pent-up frustration with the stranglehold fanatics has on the sports apparel market, consistently poor qc on their products and growing discontent with the tenure of the current mlb commissioner are nothing new, but to a lot of fans who love baseball, seeing how bad the new jerseys is a sign that the sport is heading in a bad direction. if the league is willing to have players wear jerseys of such poor quality, what does that say about how much they care about the game people adore?   "
"     you will probably see similar headlines again when fanatics begins producing game-worn jerseys for the nhl soon, and i am sure that 90% of this comment will still be relevant when that happens.   "
"     i got accosted in giant in fairfax last night by a woman with kids in tow holding up a sign that she wanted money. she basically wanted me to pay for her cart full of groceries. not a big deal, but she and her cart and kids  (wearing new nike shoes) tailgated me throughout the store. eventually she left me alone and went on to another customer. it‚Äôs unnerving to say the least.

     nike is definitely not getting enough heat for this   
     when he broke out the 2 iron stinger and hit it farther than a lot of guys on tour hit 3 wood or driver.

"     he had a nike contract but had a performance clause, he could play whatever equipment he felt would help him win.   "
"     then you‚Äôve got the crowds. i was at a kapalua for the mb. there was a small crowd even for golf standards, and there would be 80% of the crowd following him or anticipating him coming and get set to watch.   "

     we‚Äôre all hypocrites to some degree. i think slavery is bad but i‚Äôve still got an iphone and nike shoes. ab thinks white women are the devil but sydney sweeney has great tits.
