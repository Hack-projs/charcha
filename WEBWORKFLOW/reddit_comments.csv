     i dont give a fuck about the fucking code! i just want to download this stupid fucking application and use it https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock#installation 
     why is there code??? make a fucking .exe file and give it to me. these dumbfucks think that everyone is a developer and understands code. well i am not and i don't understand it. i only know to download and install applications. so why the fuck is there code? make an exe file and give it to me. stupid fucking smelly nerds   
     this might be the biggest no shit sherlock thing ever. they wouldn't put out a game that wouldn't be able to run on the up to date current generation of consoles.

     house = holmes   
     whoever wrote that article is just making shit up. his name is a sherlock holmes reference.   
     no shit sherlock holmes   
     maybe? listen i'm no sherlock just a stoner really looking forward to fighting elden hippos.

     i did an iq test once that asked what the name of the creator of sherlock holmes was. this was a pen and paper iq test i paid money for.   
     wasn't this just mentioned in a tv show or movie or something.   
     sherlock?   
     only make your players roll something when you have something that -is interesting -and moves the plot forward when they fail. otherwise they should just do it. it doesn't take sherlock holmes to find a letter in a guys pocket saying he's gonna ice the king. but someone with investigation would know that's probably not his handwriting and the real killer is gonna use that distraction or whatever.   
"     if the representation in the show is literal, it might be that he suffers from prosopagnosia -- the inability to recognize faces.   "
"     faces are so difficult to deal with, and so important (from a survival perspective), that there is a region of the brain that is dedicated to processing them (the fusiform gyrus). if the area is nonfunctional, it can cause a person to simply have trouble identifying faces (sort of how a person with no interest in automobiles might have trouble distinguishing makes of car). if it is, instead, defective, it can lead to a person being completely incapable of even perceiving faces -- you could literally put a picture of marylin monroe's next to one of danny devito's and they'd be unable to distinguish them, because their brain literally fails to see them. i've heard it described as though there's just a void where people's faces should be -- making the colloquial term for the condition, ""face blindness"", rather apt.   "
"     if maomao is aware of this, her ploy with the manicures is truly a cruel one -- people with prosopagnosia have to rely on clothing, hairstyle, gait, voice, and other physical traits to identify people. considering maomao's superior observational skills, it's possible lakan can differentiate people by looking at their hands (similar to how sherlock holmes and derived detectives often can identify a person's profession). he may even rely on this in the rear palace, where most people wear uniform clothing and hairstyles, which would explain why it's easy for him to distinguish men from women -- as well as different military ranks. softening, cleaning, and painting everyone's hands might, to him, have the same effect of putting a mask on everyone he sees. it'd be incredibly disorientating.   "
"     and then, of course, maomao painting her own nails and (i assume) preparing to play go with him in the next episode would be the perfect way to twist the knife.   "
"     (it's also possible that prosopagnosia is why lakan looked so shocked when he saw jinshi carrying maomao -- he might not have known who was carrying her, since jinshi would be completely unrecognizable in ceremonial garb. though i would assume he'd find out at some point -- weird that there isn't a bunch of gossip about that whole thing.)   "
"     this is just my own musings, though -- i wouldn't have even thought of prosopagnosia if it weren't for the fact i recalled a villain in a certain visual novel with the condition.   "
"     people are agreeing with this here, so let me just say that github is not an app store. it's a git host. it's meant for developers, not for people to download applications. hell, most projects on there aren't even applications in themselves and they certainly aren't intended for non-developers to just download and use.   "
"     if you're looking for an application and can only find it on github, with no obvious way to install it, that isn't github's fault, it's the developers'. assuming that's the intended audience for the application, it's better to provide a different portal for installing.   "
"     regardless, in that project, all you'd need to do is clone the repository and run the main file in a command line, sherlock.py [input]. there are clear instructions on how to do this. if you honestly cannot even manage this, then your complaints are irrelevant to me.   "
     god forbid someone uses an artistic portrayal in media to display the difference between putins imperial ambitions and ukraines struggle for survival.   
     all these russian bootlickers yapping about how this is on purpose. no shit sherlock. it's to make it easier for the viewer to understand the situation in ukraine - because this is the ukrainian reality. it's what russia has done to that nation.
